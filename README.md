# Solid Test

Flutter Test Assignment.

## Description

I used GitHub Actions in this project to set automatic build and deployment on pull request and push. I configure this in every project, cause it helps and speeds up development. It's a second layer of security, if PR review process goes ok, for example. Besides it can significantly reduce amount of time needed for building/testing/deployment to stores.
For `main` branch I also configured automatic deployment of Flutter Web application to GitHub Pages. So you can check application right here, in your browser. Here is a link to my application - [GitHub Pages](https://luxorum.github.io/solid_test/#/).

## Getting Started

1. Clone this project.
2. Run `flutter pub get` in terminal.
3. Run it on your device by executing `flutter run`.
